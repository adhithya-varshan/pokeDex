1) the accuaracy of xception model exceeeds that of a custom CNN as expected.
2) when, the layers were frozen(before fine-tuning), we can see the model doesn't perform as expected
the reason being, the weights at that point of training is determined via chances, whereas after unfreezing the layers, we get a really good model
(weights getting trained acccording to features recognised)
No wonder xception won the model of the year as its performance is impeccable
if a different dataset, something similiar to imagenet were to be used...the performance would be even better, as it is pretraiend on imagenet with good 
weights and bias.
